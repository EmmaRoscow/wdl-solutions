## This repo
In 2023 I competed in the World Data League competition in a group of four called **AI Wonder Girls**. In the third and final phase, our entry was the winning solution scored on technical, product and communication metrics. This repo is forked from the official World Data League repo (which contains all the code that was produced throughout the several editions of WDL) to showcase our entries to the three phases. It is completely open-source and free to use, under the MIT License.

* In the first phase, we tried to develop a graph neural network to predict mobility flows into the city of Lisbon during morning rush hours, to identify possible interventions for promoting soft mobility and reducing private vehicle use. Although we ultimately struggled to implement the graph neural network, our intended solution stands as useful inspiration for future work.
* In the second phase, we collated environmental factors that might affect coastal marine biodiversity in Portugal and developed a time series model to understand which factors affect the diversity of species. We show that human factors, not weather factors, are likely to explain the ecological stress in the intertidal populations.
* In the third phase, we designed an optimisation algorithm to propose urban sustainable energy communities, sharing ownership of rooftop solar panels with limitations on startup costs. Our solution puts intended users (those vulnerable to energy poverty) at the centre and is accessible via a Streamlit app which considers their needs.

## WDL Editions
Every edition features challenges surrounding the topic `Data-driven communities`, focussing around one or more of the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) from the United Nations.

## About World Data League
Hey world, we are the **World Data League team**!
Most of us come from the Data Science field and what connects us is the belief that applying data to problems can genuinely impact society. We believe in the power of communities and that it’s possible to achieve much more when we unite our strengths and skills and work together.
Our team has experience creating online and offline communities and organising kick-ass events and competitions for technical audiences. Why are we doing this? We want to create a global community of data scientists that compete to solve social-oriented problems while having lots of fun.

### Our Values
- We are global
- We are a League
- We don’t do bullshit
- We help data scientists
